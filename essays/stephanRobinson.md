I have started recently to incorporate this approach into my own theory teaching, with an encouraging degree of success. This essay focuses on the enhanced podcast, one tool I have used in my inverted classes and as a supplement in my traditional classes. Like a traditional audio podcast, an enhanced podcast can include pre-recorded or instructor-created audio; the “enhancements” are images and web links. This format allows students to consume content (that is, the theory, history, or ear training material) at their own pace in an accessible, personalized manner. As [Black](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Feric.ed.gov%2F%3Fid%3DEJ872487&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFe8HDTUcgFxiePmkBBklpbZ9if3Q) and others note, electronic formats are especially appropriate for the millennial generation, but they are potentially useful for all students. Figure 1 compares features of various content-delivery formats for academic music classes; the enhanced podcast occupies a nice middleground between textbooks and screencasts/videos. It is very inexpensive and personal, yet bandwidth demands and instructor time commitment are relatively low.

II. Examples of applications {.c21 .c36 .c2}
============================

Enhanced podcasts can be useful throughout the typical university music curriculum for classes such as fundamentals, ear training, tonal theory, form and analysis, post-tonal theory, and music literature and history. Below, I describe enhanced podcasts for three of these classes: fundamentals, form and analysis, and ear training.

Music fundamentals. Enhanced podcasts are particularly appropriate for music fundamentals topics, as they allow students to work repeatedly through material at their own pace. Many of my students have reported how important this flexibility is to them. [Example 1](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0rOIBDWklVoTTlzaTlzeGtpNVE/edit) is an edited version of an enhanced podcast introducing roman numerals (RNs). My goal was for students to come to class understanding the basic elements of roman numeral analysis in major keys. For each diatonic triad, I wanted students to know its typical quality, its moveable-do solfège syllables, how to write its roman numeral, and its name (e.g., ii is the supertonic triad). Building upon students’ prior knowledge, I created a podcast consisting of the components shown in Figure 2.

1

Introduction

Bullet points: purpose of RNs, same structure in all major keys, etc.

Voiceover: I talk through the bullet points, elaborating slightly.

2

C-major scale with solfège

C-major scale with solfège

I review the syllables.

3

C-major scale with scale-degree numbers

C-major scale with scale-degree numbers

I explain the scale-degree carets, another way to indicate a note’s position within a major key.

4

C-major scale with degree-names

C-major scale with degree-names (tonic, supertonic, etc.)

I go over the names.

5

Diatonic triads in C major

Each one shown with syllables and a RN

With reference to the chord progression the class is used to singing, I explain the chord qualities and that roman numerals indicate the qualities by using upper- or lower-case letters.

6

Triads in CM with triad names

Same as previous, but adds “tonic triad,” etc.

I go over the name of each triad.

7

Apply your understanding

Text directions: write the diatonic triads in Ab major, using accidentals

I explain what I want the students to do.

8

Answers to “Apply”

Diatonic triads in A-flat major (notation, solfège, and triad names)

I give the answers and spell the chords, noting what kinds of errors I anticipate the students might make (e.g., clef errors, mis-remembering the key signature).

9

Try-it - Part A

Four examples for students to write (various keys, chords, and clefs)

I speak the directions on the image, elaborating slightly.

10

Part A -answers

Answers to previous

I give and explain the answers, again noting some possible errors.

11

Try-it - Part B

Four examples for students to analyze (various keys, chords, and clefs), including one triad not in the given key

I speak the directions on the image, elaborating slightly.

12

Part B -answers

Answers to previous

I give and explain the answers, additionally indicating each triad’s root and quality (e.g., “D-minor triad”). For the triad not in the given key, I explain it is a chromatic rather than diatonic triad, thereby introducing in a non-threatening way a topic that will come up later in the theory sequence.

To conclude, I mention the class will explore the topic in further depth during the next class meeting, and encourage their questions. I also remind the class that they will take a mini-quiz on the material at the beginning of the next period.

After assigning the enhanced podcast, I started the next class with a mini-quiz, which takes only a few minutes to administer and about 10 minutes to grade. Mini-quizzes are easy for students who watched the podcast. They effectively hold students accountable, which I have found vital for success in my inverted teaching. For the remainder of the roman numeral lesson, students completed a worksheet with similar examples, and then learned a more sophisticated application of the concept: combining roman numerals with figures that indicate chord positions.

Form and analysis. In an upper-level form and analysis class, it can be very difficult to get students to make the transition from the narrowly detailed focus typically emphasized in lower levels to the bigger-picture view necessary to understand complete movements. The audiovisual form chart, which eliminates musical notation altogether, can be very helpful in this regard. [Example 2](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fenhancedpodcastsmusicclassroom.blogspot.com%2F2014%2F07%2Fexample-2.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGMLC3CsFMYTnjQt9n1_PsnBo4wOA), an enhanced podcast introducing a unit on sonata form, demonstrates. (Other programs that can be used to make form charts are [Variations Audio Timeliner](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fvariations.sourceforge.net%2Fvat%2Findex.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGhq0DvYQgwyxcNxrA4HHCXErMobw)and [Audacity](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.flipcamp.org%2Fengagingstudents%2Fpeebles.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNE8NUmnYZRGs7F-sW3j3Sxp01c2Bg).) I start with a brief overview of typical formal features, and give suggestions--spoken and bullet points--about what students should listen for. Then a recording of the first movement of Mozart’s Serenade, K. 525, is annotated with the large-scale sections of the form as well as a few elements of each of the smaller thematic areas (such as its phrase structure, texture, and cadences). Each large section has its own color to help students keep track of the form. I encourage students to navigate through chapters to compare occurrences of the themes, so they can discover similarities and differences. In a future iteration of this podcast, I am considering adding spoken annotation to the text.

Ear training. As [Trevor de Clercq](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.flipcamp.org%2Fengagingstudents%2FdeClercq.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFS5ln7dEHE87dnYbodtijucAWSaw) notes, the ear training classroom also provides opportunities to invert instruction. Here, enhanced podcasts can prove especially useful in helping instructors manage the ever-too-limited class time, by supplementing both performance and listening activities. An enhanced podcast can combine aural and visual modalities in helping students prepare a melody for performance, especially one that has features not immediately apparent. For instance, Example 3a can look intimidating to students who do not perceive the underlying linear connections between nonadjacent notes. A podcast including annotations (such as those in Ex. 3b, which may accumulate gradually) and the intervallic reduction (Ex. 3c) will help students understand the underlying structure, (hopefully) allowing them to transfer this procedure to new melodies.

Example 3. A compound melody for performance (from [Berkowitz et al,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fopenlibrary.org%2Fworks%2FOL16010686W%2FA_new_approach_to_sight_singing&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGQ-UXOOBwtXfkvvP0xkspyvaDOjQ)[A New Approach to Sight Singing](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fopenlibrary.org%2Fworks%2FOL16010686W%2FA_new_approach_to_sight_singing&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGQ-UXOOBwtXfkvvP0xkspyvaDOjQ))

![enhpodcast\_ex5b.jpg](images/image02.jpg)

c\) Intervallic reduction

![enhpodcast\_ex5c.jpg](images/image01.jpg)

Similarly, enhanced podcasts can provide students with effective strategies for focusing on particular elements of a dictation exercise in a low-stress situation outside of class time. Especially beneficial would be a podcast containing a dictation exercise with various “hints”--using any combination of graphics, printed text, and audio--in the different chapters. This would allow students to focus individually on whichever elements they find most useful.

III. Making and distributing enhanced podcasts {.c2 .c36}
==============================================

There are two easy ways to create an enhanced podcast. Instructors with Apple computers can use GarageBand. Instructors without access to this program may use a browser based program requiring no additional software beyond basic audio recording/editing.

GarageBand. [Older versions of Apple’s GarageBand](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fkb%2FHT5971%3Fviewlocale%3Den_US%26locale%3Den_US&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNH53tQp5Us1W5NhKUpx3D5DWxTsVQ)[ software](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fkb%2FHT5971%3Fviewlocale%3Den_US%26locale%3Den_US&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNH53tQp5Us1W5NhKUpx3D5DWxTsVQ) offer an excellent balance of functionality and ease of use. The program’s audio capacity allows more tracks than instructors will possibly need, and manipulations such as duplicating, cutting and copying, fading, balance, and level are accomplished with just a few clicks. Instructors can add images (which are created and edited outside the program) by dragging and dropping. Once a podcast is created, the program can export it into the correct format. [Appendix 1](#id.btfapuzkul7) provides instructions.

Auphonic/Podigee. Instructors without access to GarageBand can make enhanced podcasts online using the browser-based programs [Auphonic](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fauphonic.com%2Flanding&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFgIHOoi9BIEMOgBITIINc359PQBw) or [Podigee](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.podigee.com%2Fen%2Fhome&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFaTIx-78Bfi1GSTiHN1t2GnXqmUw). Both operate on the “Freemium” pricing model and allow users with a free account to create either one (Podigee) or two (Auphonic) hours of podcasts per month. To create a podcast using either of these services, a user will create the audio track offline (using software such as [Audacity](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Faudacity.sourceforge.net&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGfhEWoDNzU1waXp73d8oqSHacSZw)), upload it, and add images and links, manually setting the timing for the enhanced features. Podigee offers the additional benefit of hosting the podcast; readers may find a brief sample in [my podcast feed](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fanna-stephan.podigee.io&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFkgkNQmBA9aRvzQ_0t4-Ein0yvrQ). Auphonic has a further benefit--an automatic post-production algorithm that improves audio quality. Additionally, Auphonic offers a free, limited-functionality app for mobile devices (iPhone, iPad, Android), allowing users to make podcasts on-the-go.

Distributing enhanced podcasts. The easiest way to distribute an enhanced podcast is via a learning management system, from which students will download the file and open it in iTunes, from there transferring it to a mobile device if desired. Alternatively, instructors can create a podcast feed and [submit it to](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fkb%2FHT1819&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHbbI8oXNPTaeLpGll27IqMCsLqog)[iTunes](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fkb%2FHT1819&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHbbI8oXNPTaeLpGll27IqMCsLqog), or host podcasts on a [blog](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fenhancedpodcastsmusicclassroom.blogspot.com&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGVXPszg8gdewC4c-XHs8L-bCLWzw). In the latter case, the podcasts will appear as videos and any links must be added manually. [Appendix 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0rOIBDWklVodld1VTZZZWdacWs/edit?usp=sharing) shows how students can watch an enhanced podcast.

IV. Closing remarks {.c21 .c36 .c2 .c38}
===================

My recent experimentation with the inverted classroom model has inspired me to continue using this method in my music theory and aural skills classes. Although time will show whether my students retain knowledge and skills better than those I taught more traditionally, I have received much positive feedback, and my students seem more engaged in the courses. I certainly enjoy teaching more when I can interact with students more directly, and observe them interacting with one another. Enhanced podcasts facilitate this interaction during class time.

I have found the enhanced podcast a useful component of both my inverted and more traditional teaching. Its benefits include the possibility of multiple simultaneous audio tracks, a relatively small file size, easy navigation for students through the chapter menu, web links, and ease of editing. Enhanced podcasts can engage students’ auditory, visual, and verbal senses, giving each student multiple opportunities to learn music in whatever ways work best for that individual. Students can repeatedly watch an enhanced podcast and navigate with ease to the most useful parts, allowing them to learn at a self-directed pace. By embracing the enhanced podcast along with other delivery formats, we instructors give ourselves one more tool to help reach every student.

[[a]](#cmnt_ref1)I second what Stephen has said, Anna. Well done. For some reason, I can't seem to get the example podcasts to work. Is there a trick to doing so? If so, maybe we could include those in an appendix too.

[[b]](#cmnt_ref2)Thanks for the feedback, Bryn.

What program are you trying to open the files with? They don't play super-nice with iPads, unless they're manually added (that is, with a wired connection through iTunes). I certainly can make another appendix, though, but not today, because I'm in the library and don't have my computer with me.

[[c]](#cmnt_ref3)I'm not sure what the problem is. I downloaded the file to my laptop. I tried to open it in iTunes, but nothing happened. Strangely, when I click the play button that comes up when you mouse-over the icon, it will play the audio. But I can't see the enhancements.

[[d]](#cmnt_ref4)That's a bit odd. Did the file extension change when you downloaded it? It should be .m4a.

When I have a m4a file on my computer, I can open it in iTunes or QuickTime player by right-clicking or control-clicking and then choosing "open with."

At any rate, I'm going to make a second appendix that covers how to open them. I'm not sure how many options I should include (e.g., how many older versions of iTunes, quickTime, etc.)

[[e]](#cmnt_ref5)I've made a second appendix showing several methods by which students can view the enhanced podcasts. I also added a post (including a few screenshots) for each appendix on the blog. I hope that helps.
