| Chapter | Title | Image | Audio |
|:-:|:-:|:-|:-|
| 1 | Introduction | Bullet points: purpose of RNs, same structure in all major keys, etc. | Voiceover: I talk through the bullet points, elaborating slightly. |
| 2 | C-major scale with solfège | C-major scale with solfège | I review the syllables. |
| 3 | C-major scale with scale-degree numbers | C-major scale with scale-degree numbers | I explain the scale-degree carets, another way to indicate a note’s position within a major key. |
| 4 | C-major scale with degree-names | C-major scale with degree-names (tonic, supertonic, etc.) | I go over the names. |
| 5 | Diatonic triads in C major | Each one shown with syllables and a RN | With reference to the chord progression the class is used to singing, I explain the chord qualities and that roman numerals indicate the qualities by using upper- or lower-case letters. |
| 6 | Triads in CM with triad names | Same as previous, but adds “tonic triad,” etc. | I go over the name of each triad. |
| 7 | Apply your understanding | Text directions: write the diatonic triads in Ab major, using accidentals | I explain what I want the students to do. |
| 8 | Answers to “Apply” | Diatonic triads in A-flat major (notation, solfège, and triad names) | I give the answers and spell the chords, noting what kinds of errors I anticipate the students might make (e.g., clef errors, mis-remembering the key signature). |
| 9 | Try-it - Part A | Four examples for students to write (various keys, chords, and clefs) | I speak the directions on the image, elaborating slightly. |
| 10 | Part A -answers | Answers to previous | I give and explain the answers, again noting some possible errors. |
| 11 | Try-it - Part B | Four examples for students to analyze (various keys, chords, and clefs), including one triad not in the given key | I speak the directions on the image, elaborating slightly. |
| 12 | Part B -answers | Answers to previous | I give and explain the answers, additionally indicating each triad’s root and quality (e.g., “D-minor triad”). For the triad not in the given key, I explain it is a chromatic rather than diatonic triad, thereby introducing in a non-threatening way a topic that will come up later in the theory sequence. To conclude, I mention the class will explore the topic in further depth during the next class meeting, and encourage their questions. I also remind the class that they will take a mini-quiz on the material at the beginning of the next period. |
