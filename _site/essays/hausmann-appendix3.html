<h2 id="appendix-358-podcast-or-video-essay">Appendix 3: Podcast or Video Essay</h2>

<p>Create a 10 minute podcast or video that analyzes a song of your choosing and presents an interpretive argument.</p>

<p>Project Goals</p>

<ol>
  <li>Analyze how musical, historical, cultural, economic, and/or technological aspects impact the composition, performance, and reception of a rock song.</li>
  <li>Distill this analysis into one key idea (thesis statement).</li>
  <li>Write an outline that clearly describes your argument (how your analysis supports your thesis statement).</li>
  <li>Critically read your colleague’s outlines and provide feedback on the argument, structure, analysis, and/or interpretation (peer review).</li>
  <li>Record and produce a podcast or video essay that share your analysis and interpretation with your colleagues and the broader community.</li>
</ol>

<p>Project Stages</p>

<p>Topic and song selection</p>

<ul>
  <li>Select a topic from the four we are addressing together (historical events, covers, place and space, and humor).</li>
  <li>Select a song to analyze. You can use any song you choose (aside from those we have covered together).</li>
  <li>Remember that we are defining “rock music” in as broad a way as possible, so be creative with your song selections! You’re also invited to make the project as relevant as possible (for example, if you’re a music education major, select a song you could use in the classroom).</li>
  <li>Submit both topic and song in a post to the course blog by [date].</li>
</ul>

<p>Song analysis</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learn and analyze your song. Some possible avenues for approaching this analysis are social/cultural, stylistic, historical, etc. You will find it helpful to approach your song from a variety of perspectives, even if all of your analysis does not end up in your final project.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Build on this analysis by interpreting your song. Ask and answer one question about your song. For example,</p>
  </li>
  <li>How does the song relate to or depict a specific historical event?</li>
  <li>How does the song present or depict places or spaces?</li>
  <li>How does the cover version differ from the original, and what is the significance of this?</li>
  <li>
    <p>What types of audiences would find this example funny and why?</p>
  </li>
  <li>I’ve included one sample question for each of our four topics, but you’re encouraged to generate your own questions.</li>
  <li>Let your analysis guide the questions you ask, and don’t be afraid to change the questions you’re asking.</li>
  <li>Work on this will be ongoing throughout the course, and feel free to contact me for advice, ideas, or assistance!</li>
</ul>

<p>Write a thesis statement and an outline.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your thesis statement describes the main point of your argument in one or two sentences description that summarizes</li>
  <li>
    <p>Your outline explains the structure of your argument and how you will prove your thesis statement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve used this format for the songs we’ve discussed throughout the course, but if you’d like to see a more explicit example, you can look at my example (posted on the course website). Include a YouTube link to the version of the song you will be writing about.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Submit these in a post to the course blog by [date].</li>
</ul>

<p>Write a rough draft of your essay.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add details to your outline that support your thesis statement. Remember that it takes approximately 2 minutes to read 1 page of double spaced text. Keep that rough guideline in mind while you’re writing (it might help to provide a link to the song or a video, so you don’t need to use too much time playing excerpts).</li>
  <li>You likely won’t be able to use all of your analysis, so carefully select those points that most clearly support your thesis statement.</li>
  <li>Submit these in a post to the course blog by [date].</li>
</ul>

<p>Peer review one of your colleague’s rough drafts.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Critically read one your colleague’s outlines.</li>
  <li>Provide feedback on the argument, structure, analysis, and/or interpretation.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure you address each of the areas from the rubric:</p>
  </li>
  <li>Depth</li>
  <li>Accuracy</li>
  <li>Logic</li>
  <li>Clarity with mechanics of writing</li>
  <li>
    <p>Precision of musical terminology</p>
  </li>
  <li>What did you think worked? Why? What do you think could use improvement? Why? Remember that the best feedback is honest, respectful, and specific. Your goal as a peer reviewer is to improve your peer’s project as much as you can.</li>
  <li>Read and respond to your colleague’s rough draft in a comment on the course blog by [date]. I will read and respond to both your rough draft and your peer reviewer’s comments by [date] at noon. My comments will be in the course blog.</li>
</ul>

<p>Record your essay either as a podcast or video.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For help recording a podcast, see the notes on the project Blackboard page. For help recording a video essay, see the notes on the project Blackboard page. If you need more extended technical help, please contact campus technical support (information in syllabus).</li>
  <li>Work on this will be ongoing, but make sure you leave yourself time for technical glitches, multiple takes, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Submit your final version of your podcast or video essay.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Please submit your podcasts as a .mp3 file.</li>
  <li>Please submit your video essays as a .avi file.</li>
  <li>Submit these me via email by [date].</li>
</ul>

<p>Listen to/watch each of your colleagues’ podcasts/video essays and respond to two of these on the discussion board.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Answer each of these questions for both of the essays that you choose to respond to:</p>
  </li>
  <li>What was your aesthetic reaction to the song?</li>
  <li>What was your professional response to the argument and thesis?</li>
  <li>
    <p>How does this essay help you interpret or understand rock music?</p>
  </li>
  <li>Submit your substantive comments on two essays in comments to the course blog by [date].</li>
</ul>
