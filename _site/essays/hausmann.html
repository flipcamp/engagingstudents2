<h1>Content in the Learner-centered Non-major Classroom&#58; Thinking and Listening Like a Musicologist</h1>

<p><strong>John Hausmann, University of Louisville</strong></p>

<p>What are we teaching students in our non-major courses? This disarmingly simple question cuts to the heart of our purpose as musician-educators. Our obligation to teach certain historical and stylistic information fuels concerns about “covering” enough material, which can cause us to lose sight of our students’ needs and the contemporary realities of college teaching. Since few of our students will ever need to recall facts about Rossini, ragas, or the Rolling Stones, what do we teach that will impact our students’ thinking and listening one, five, or ten years after the end of our courses? I suggest that our greatest value for our non-major students lies in our discipline-specific strategies for listening to, writing about, and thinking about music.Framed this way, our classroom goals shift, and we must rethink our traditional ideas of musicological content.Our customary materials—famous works and composers, historical contexts, styles, and the like—remain important, but as models to demonstrate how experts hear and understand music.</p>

<p>Learning how to listen to and think about music impacts our students’ thought processes in a way that regurgitating Bach’s dates cannot. Moreover, this approach is rooted in a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facultyfocus.com%2Farticles%2Feffective-teaching-strategies%2Ffive-characteristics-of-learner-centered-teaching%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFBvMfRev6FWnPxLKL3NwJwqmaL_w">learner-centered</a> approach to content.

[and] create learner awareness.” Many non-major offerings are geared towards the first purpose, but this new balance of foundational understanding, disciplinary competence, and metacognition furthers the premise that true learning prepares students for a lifetime of self-directed education. It also replicates how we approach and understand our content: building on existing knowledge, we read, research, and analyze music to understand it more deeply, all the while reflecting on our own thought processes.</p>

<p>If we consider our content to be musicological thought and our materials as a means of modeling these techniques, how can this impact our teaching? Here are three examples I have used in a variety of non-major undergraduate classes. In my first example, ^<a href="#cmnt1">[a]</a>^I created a case study for a unit on music and war. I had my students answer a number of questions^<a href="#cmnt2">[b]</a>^that I drew from <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fconnection.ebscohost.com%2Fc%2Farticles%2F42427672%2Fall-sounds-life-rage-musical-imagery-writings-civil-war-soldiers&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHKE5MoCRZfTuJfk_uZDXb-uufhew">James Davis’s</a> “‘All Sounds of Life and Rage:’ Musical Imagery in the Writings of Civil War Soldiers.” The case study provided my students with an active learning environment that allowed them to approach historical documents like a musicologist researching a topic. Students engaged in the material by making connections between background knowledge (from class materials and the article itself) and new information, analyzing primary sources and answering interpretive questions, and evaluating the relationship between their conclusions and Davis’s. These are all vital musicological skills and model thought processes that resonate with a number of different disciplines and other real-world situations.</p>

<p>I used my second example ^<a href="#cmnt3">[c]</a>^to blend summative and formative assessment in a final exam for a topically-arranged lower-level music appreciation course. I organized this class around two <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fsharepoint.louisville.edu%2Fsites%2Fsphis%2Facprogs%2Fph101%2Fdev%2FShared%2520Documents%2FCentral%2520question%2520and%2520FPC%2520defs%2520and%2520examples.docx&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE2MQTrl-OxguAPz6gFsI_kgqCaPA">fundamental and powerful concepts</a>: music is inherently both a social experience and polyvalent. FPCs are a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fopenlibrary.org%2Fworks%2FOL6447755W%2FLearning_to_Think_Things_Through&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGKon9gLqTOo_YOHQibY3m-x8m2kg">discipline’s underlying, structural ideas</a>. Not only do they provide a common thread to tie together a semester’s worth of material, they are the types of ideas that can impact your students’ thinking long after the course’s conclusion. I wanted to use this last opportunity to reinforce the links between my FPCs and the materials we’d studied all term. The assignment began with students recalling why concepts from certain units were illustrated by specific pieces (examples can be found in the appendix^<a href="#cmnt4">[d]</a>^). Building on their knowledge base, students then had to determine how the same music could have functioned in another unit, justifying their decisions with specific musical evidence. Not only did this assignment reinforce the understanding that each unit we studied provided a critical lens through which they could interpret music, it demonstrated that there are multiple ways of listening to and interpreting any piece or song, a key aspect of contemporary musicological thought.</p>

<p>While the assignment’s first part focused on social and interpretive issues, the second partstressed technical competencies. My students completed an assessment that <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fopenlibrary.org%2Fworks%2FOL4305807W%2FClassroom_assessment_techniques&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNERcEw62IFskuZRi3ad093GIM9JAw">Thomas Angelo and Patricia Cross</a> term a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.uakron.edu%2FdotAsset%2F2292489.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE0O0xBH3Pm6iFPDrLQd3LvoqywWQ">defining features matrix</a>, which was intended to make connections between different musics based purely on stylistic characteristics. This part of the assignment helped my students transfer and generalize listening skills they initially learned with specific examples. It also demonstrated a foundational aspect of music listening we often take for granted: we frequently apply similar listening techniques to a variety of pieces or styles. For example, when we hear homophonic music, we know to focus our listening on the primary voice and how it interacts with the supporting material. While we can adjust our ears automatically, I have found that non-musicians often struggle to apply existing aural models or scripts to new or unfamiliar pieces, unaware that the act of isolating the melody in a Mozart symphony or a Madonna song relies on similar techniques. Practicing these skills not only allows them to hear better, it helps them make connections with a diverse range of musics and think about familiar music in different ways.</p>

<p>My final example^<a href="#cmnt5">[e]</a>^was inspired by Ryan Bañagale’s presentation at last year’s <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.american-music.org%2Fconferences%2FLancaster%2FLancasterConferenceSchedule_Final.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFCYve63l_YD3PGH6Tb5cskoMHp9A">Society for American Music conference</a>. Over the course of a semester, I wanted my rock history students to create a ten-minute podcast or video that analyzed a song or piece of their choosing while developing, refining, and presenting an interpretive argument. Students were to determine the best structure for their argument, write multiple drafts, engage in a peer review process, and create a final product consumable by their colleagues and the larger community. The various stages of this project not only suggest a model for working on and finishing a long-term project but also provide insight into the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.flipcamp.org%2Fengagingstudents%2Frifkin.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHgs4EmGNUOqs6ie5gntazRHGNLMg">collaborative nature</a> of musicking and the research process. The peer reviewprocess in particular requires students to thoughtfully comment on each stage of a colleague’s project and evaluate their work according to a rubric (which could be student-generated in upper level courses). Through this, students learn how to give constructive and helpful feedback and how to critically engage with a coworker’s project by articulating strengths, observing weaknesses, and suggesting solutions. Giving students opportunities to critique and direct their classmates’ work provides a space to practice valuable interpersonal skills applicable to a wide variety of careers and allows them to actively support and guide their colleague’s growing understanding of the material. This authentic assessment engages students in all aspects of musicology, from conception and interpretation to revision and presentation.</p>

<p>With a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fopenlibrary.org%2Fworks%2FOL9240218W%2FDeveloping_Learner-Centered_Teaching_A_Practical_Guide_for_Faculty&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG5NTAJ74Cc_nozNztk088xstIluQ">learner-centered approach</a> to content, I observed two major changes in my teaching practice. First, my emphasis shifted from “what will I cover today?” to “what will the students do today?” Second, I reconceived my course content, de-emphasizingrote memorization of facts and instead focusing on giving students the conceptual tools of our disciplines, the mental and aural pathways we use to hear and understand music. These sample assignments reinforced my students&#39; factual knowledgewhile also training them to become aware of how they listen and what they could do with that information. My students were active and engaged in developing the skills necessary to become lifelong learners and intelligent consumers of music. Aside from the practical advantages, this approach encourages students to understand their experiences in college not merely as onerous consumption of discrete information but as opportunities to think and metacognate through new intellectual pathways.</p>

<p>Appendix 1—Article Case Study, Music and the American Civil War</p>

<p>A scholar finds numerous references to music and sound in soldiers’ letters from the American Civil War. After reading and studying these letters, the scholar comes to several conclusions about what these letters can tell us about musical life before and during the war. You’ve been given the excerpts from the letters, and will need to read them to understand how references to music and sound are being used, and what they are being used for. This gives you an opportunity to approach a primary source (the letters) like a scholar researching the same topic would.</p>

<p>Directions</p>

<ol>
<li> There are several interpretive questions below. Building on our class discussions, your reading, and your understanding of the context below, answer these questions.</li>
<li> Type your answers directly into the submission box on Blackboard by [date]. Please do not attach a separate document containing your answers.</li>
<li> Bring your answers with you to class on [date] for our follow-up discussion.</li>
</ol>

<p>Context</p>

<ol>
<li> Millions of combatants and family members were intellectually and emotionally unprepared for war.</li>
<li> Letters were means of communicating with family and friends back on the home front.</li>
<li> Letters were also attempt to cope with emotional and spiritual trauma of war.</li>
<li> These documents reveal the problem of conveying a “tale as may be told by a soldier who is no writer to a reader who is no soldier.”</li>
<li><p>One question this raises:</p></li>
<li><p>Why would soldiers use musical ideas in their letters? In other words, why would they use language from an important part of “normal life” to convey aspects of war to their friends and family back home?</p></li>
<li><p>Two possible answers:</p></li>
<li><p>Musical terminology and concepts gives both writer and reader a shared set of ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>These references served as a means of emotional communication.</p></li>
<li><p>Such letters tell us how pervasive music was in 19th century American life.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Musical References in Soldiers’ Letters</p>

<ul>
<li>  “the bullets from the rebel line whizzed about our ears at the rate of at least thirty a minute.”</li>
<li>  “The fire opened – bang, bang, bang, a rattle de bang, bang, bang, a boom, de bang, bang, bang, boom, bang, boom, bang, boom, bang, boom, bang, boom, bang, whirr-siz-siz-siz, a ripping, roaring boom, bang!”</li>
</ul>

<p>Question 1</p>

<ul>
<li>  In these two (2) letters, how are music/sound depicted? Why is there so much repetition in the second letter? What effect does this repetition create?</li>
</ul>

<p>Musical References in Soldiers’ Letters</p>

<ul>
<li>  Sound of cannons at Gettysburg as “continuous and loud as that from the falls of Niagara.”</li>
<li>  Battle of Chickamauga “seemed more like the mighty roar of a dozen Niagaras than anything nearly human.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Question 2</p>

<ul>
<li>  These 2 letters compare the sounds of two different battles to that of the waterfalls at Niagara Falls. Why?</li>
<li>  What could these references tell us about the sonic environment of 1860s America?</li>
</ul>

<p>Musical References in Soldiers’ Letters</p>

<ul>
<li>  “The wild cries of charging lines, the rattle of musketry, the booming of artillery and the shrieks of the wounded were the orchestral accompaniments of a scene like very hell itself.”</li>
<li>  “What a variety of hideous noises. The ping of the minnie ball, the splutter of canister, the whistling of grape . . . and the cannon’s roar from a hundred mouth’s went to make up the music for the great opera of death.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Question 3</p>

<ul>
<li>  These 2 letters reference music explicitly. How do they do this?</li>
<li>  Why would these soldiers compare the horrific sounds of battle to the very different sounds of a concert?</li>
<li>  What could these references tell us about the musical life of 1860s America?</li>
</ul>

<p>Musical References in Soldiers’ Letters</p>

<ul>
<li>  “While halting for a little rest just after daybreak, we hear that sound which I believe strikes a chill through the bravest man that lives, and causes him to feel that his heart is sinking down, down, till it seems to drop into his boots. I mean the dull rustling of air which is hardly more than a vibration, but which to the experienced listener betokens artillery firing at a distance.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Question 4</p>

<ul>
<li>  The final letter contains a very subtle reference to music/sound. What is this reference?</li>
</ul>

<p>What does this letter––more than any of our other examples––give you a sense of?</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<ul>
<li>  “The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battle-field, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Question 5</p>

<ul>
<li>  The final quotation is from Lincoln’s first Inaugural Address. Describe how Lincoln uses references to music, and what he uses these references for.</li>
<li>  How can you put this in the broader context of 19th century American musical life?</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Appendix 2—Final Assignment</p>

<p>We’ve taken a variety of approaches to studying music this semester, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Music and Ethnicity,</li>
<li>  Music and Gender,</li>
<li>  Music and Spirituality,</li>
<li>  Music and Politics,</li>
<li>  Music and War,</li>
<li>  Music and Love,</li>
<li>  Music and Art,</li>
<li>  Music and Literature, and</li>
<li>  Music and Narrative.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because music is inherently social(the first fundamental and powerful concept of this class), we can relate pieces/songs we’ve studied to multiple topics, creating different meanings from the same piece of music(the second fundamental and powerful concept of this class).</p>

<p>Building on this work, the first partof this assignment involves selecting ten (10) different pieces/songs that we studied this semester (either in class or that were included in the textbook). For eachof these pieces/songs, answer these questions:</p>

<ol>
<li> Which unit did we originally study the music in? Why?</li>
<li> What is another unit that we could have studied the music in? Why?</li>
</ol>

<p>For example:</p>

<ol>
<li> We discussed Alexander Borodin’s In the Steppes of Central Asiain our Music and Politics unit because of the political aspects of 19th century European nationalism.</li>
<li> We could have discussed this piece during the Music and Ethnicity unit (because of its constructions of Russian and Asian identities), or during the Music and Narrative unit (since the piece tells a story through the travels and interactions of the three main themes).</li>
</ol>

<p>Next, focus on one of your answers from above. For one of these pieces/songs, answer this question:</p>

<ol>
<li> What specific musical evidence can you give to support your argument for including this piece/song in a different unit?</li>
</ol>

<p>For example:</p>

<ol>
<li> We discussed Moore’s “Ballad of the Green Berets” during the Music and War unit, but we could have discussed this piece during the Music and Gender unit. The song does many things to construct a masculine identity for the narrator. Lyrically, the men are portrayed as brave, fearless, loyal, honest (“Men who mean just what they say”), as “America’s best,” as elite and skilled (because of the testing and rigorous requirements for joining—“only 3 win the Green Beret”), courageous, willing to fight and die for their ideals (“he has died for those oppressed”), tough (the line “Her Green Beret has met his fate” uses the word “fate,” which makes it seem that the men are so tough and so well trained that only fate––something preordained from some higher power––can end their lives (not an enemy soldier, an accident, etc.), and dedicated (his willingness to have his son fight and possibly die). Musically, the song reinforces these lyrical ideas. Instruments like a snare drum and trumpets have associations with war, leading us to hear these instruments as “manly.” The lead singer is a man, but he does not croon or sing emotionally (he doesn’t use vibrato or bend his voice into any of the pitches like any of the blues singers we talked about; rather, he sings each note clearly and plainly, without excessive, “feminine” displays of affection). The melody is clear and direct, almost exclusively on the beat with little syncopation, much like the men the text describes (“Men who mean just what they say”). When additional singers enter, they are all men. Finally, the organ reinforces lyrical references to family and constructs ideas of men being traditional, stable, religious, faithful, loyal, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the second part of this assignment, complete this defining features matrix. This matrix needs to have ten (10) stylistic features, six (6) of which should be musical. The other four (4) items can either be musical or social (who uses the piece, what they use it for, etc.). If you need inspiration, use our listening framework––what instruments/voices you hear, what texture you hear, etc.</p>

<p>–Create a 10 minute podcast or video that analyzes a song of your choosing and presents an interpretive argument.</p>

<p>Project Goals</p>

<ol>
<li> Analyze how musical, historical, cultural, economic, and/or technological aspects impact the composition, performance, and reception of a rock song.</li>
<li> Distill this analysis into one key idea (thesis statement).</li>
<li> Write an outline that clearly describes your argument (how your analysis supports your thesis statement).</li>
<li> Critically read your colleague’s outlines and provide feedback on the argument, structure, analysis, and/or interpretation (peer review).</li>
<li> Record and produce a podcast or video essay that share your analysis and interpretation with your colleagues and the broader community.</li>
</ol>

<p>Project Stages</p>

<p>Topic and song selection</p>

<ul>
<li>  Select a topic from the four we are addressing together (historical events, covers, place and space, and humor).</li>
<li>  Select a song to analyze. You can use any song you choose (aside from those we have covered together).</li>
<li>  Remember that we are defining “rock music” in as broad a way as possible, so be creative with your song selections! You’re also invited to make the project as relevant as possible (for example, if you’re a music education major, select a song you could use in the classroom).</li>
<li>  Submit both topic and song in a post to the course blog by [date].</li>
</ul>

<p>Song analysis</p>

<ul>
<li>  Learn and analyze your song. Some possible avenues for approaching this analysis are social/cultural, stylistic, historical, etc. You will find it helpful to approach your song from a variety of perspectives, even if all of your analysis does not end up in your final project.</li>
<li><p>Build on this analysis by interpreting your song. Ask and answer one question about your song. For example,</p></li>
<li><p>How does the song relate to or depict a specific historical event?</p></li>
<li><p>How does the song present or depict places or spaces?</p></li>
<li><p>How does the cover version differ from the original, and what is the significance of this?</p></li>
<li><p>What types of audiences would find this example funny and why?</p></li>
<li><p>I’ve included one sample question for each of our four topics, but you’re encouraged to generate your own questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Let your analysis guide the questions you ask, and don’t be afraid to change the questions you’re asking.</p></li>
<li><p>Work on this will be ongoing throughout the course, and feel free to contact me for advice, ideas, or assistance!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Write a thesis statement and an outline.</p>

<ul>
<li>  Your thesis statement describes the main point of your argument in one or two sentences description that summarizes</li>
<li><p>Your outline explains the structure of your argument and how you will prove your thesis statement.</p></li>
<li><p>I’ve used this format for the songs we’ve discussed throughout the course, but if you’d like to see a more explicit example, you can look at my example (posted on the course website). Include a YouTube link to the version of the song you will be writing about.</p></li>
<li><p>Submit these in a post to the course blog by [date].</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Write a rough draft of your essay.</p>

<ul>
<li>  Add details to your outline that support your thesis statement. Remember that it takes approximately 2 minutes to read 1 page of double spaced text. Keep that rough guideline in mind while you’re writing (it might help to provide a link to the song or a video, so you don’t need to use too much time playing excerpts).</li>
<li>  You likely won’t be able to use all of your analysis, so carefully select those points that most clearly support your thesis statement.</li>
<li>  Submit these in a post to the course blog by [date].</li>
</ul>

<p>Peer review one of your colleague’s rough drafts.</p>

<ul>
<li>  Critically read one your colleague’s outlines.</li>
<li>  Provide feedback on the argument, structure, analysis, and/or interpretation.</li>
<li><p>Make sure you address each of the areas from the rubric:</p></li>
<li><p>Depth</p></li>
<li><p>Accuracy</p></li>
<li><p>Logic</p></li>
<li><p>Clarity with mechanics of writing</p></li>
<li><p>Precision of musical terminology</p></li>
<li><p>What did you think worked? Why? What do you think could use improvement? Why? Remember that the best feedback is honest, respectful, and specific. Your goal as a peer reviewer is to improve your peer’s project as much as you can.</p></li>
<li><p>Read and respond to your colleague’s rough draft in a comment on the course blog by [date]. I will read and respond to both your rough draft and your peer reviewer’s comments by [date] at noon. My comments will be in the course blog.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Record your essay either as a podcast or video.</p>

<ul>
<li>  For help recording a podcast, see the notes on the project Blackboard page. For help recording a video essay, see the notes on the project Blackboard page. If you need more extended technical help, please contact campus technical support (information in syllabus).</li>
<li>  Work on this will be ongoing, but make sure you leave yourself time for technical glitches, multiple takes, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Submit your final version of your podcast or video essay.</p>

<ul>
<li>  Please submit your podcasts as a .mp3 file.</li>
<li>  Please submit your video essays as a .avi file.</li>
<li>  Submit these me via email by [date].</li>
</ul>

<p>Listen to/watch each of your colleagues’ podcasts/video essays and respond to two of these on the discussion board.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Answer each of these questions for both of the essays that you choose to respond to:</p></li>
<li><p>What was your aesthetic reaction to the song?</p></li>
<li><p>What was your professional response to the argument and thesis?</p></li>
<li><p>How does this essay help you interpret or understand rock music?</p></li>
<li><p>Submit your substantive comments on two essays in comments to the course blog by [date].</p></li>
</ul>
